Coursera Course Practical Tasks

In this course, I learned how to create a job recommendation system as the final project, applying many of the skills I developed throughout the program. I explored the Hugging Face community, an open-source AI platform, and learned about its powerful NLP models. I also learned how to generate a Hugging Face API key and use the Hugging Face Inference API for feature extraction.  

The course provided a structured learning experience. In the first lesson, I discovered the purpose of the Hugging Face community and how to incorporate its models into my projects. The second lesson included a practice project, which gave me step-by-step guidance to build a recommendation system. This helped me prepare for the final project, which I completed independently. Additionally, I had the opportunity to evaluate a peerâ€™s project using a rubric and demonstrate my understanding of the course through a graded quiz.  

Overall, this course helped me strengthen my skills in developing AI applications, evaluating projects, and working with advanced tools like Hugging Face. It was a valuable experience that gave me practical knowledge and hands-on expertise in building recommendation systems.

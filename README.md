Coursera Course Practical Tasks

This course culminates in the creation of a job recommendation system, integrating the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the program. It introduces learners to the Hugging Face community, an open-source AI platform, and its diverse NLP models, which can enhance project development.

The course is structured into two lessons and a final project. In the first lesson, students explore Hugging Faceâ€™s features, learning to generate and utilize API keys for feature extraction through the Hugging Face Inference API. The second lesson includes a practice project with step-by-step instructions to prepare for the independently completed and peer-graded final project.

By the end of the course, students will have:

Developed a practical application using skills from previous modules.
Gained experience evaluating projects using a structured rubric.
Demonstrated comprehension of the final project through a graded quiz.
Understood the purpose and functionality of the Hugging Face community and tools.
This hands-on module strengthens students' technical abilities and their understanding of AI-driven recommendation systems.
